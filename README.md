# resonanceReconstruction
`resonanceReconstruction` contains all the code to perform resonance reconstruction of nuclear data. It's primary purpose is to be used in the modern [RECONR](https://github.com/njoy/RECONR) component of [NJOY21](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21).

In the resolved region, it reconstructs resonances contained with these formalisms:

- Single-level Breit Wigner (SLBW)
- Multi-level Breit Wigner (MLBW)
- Reich-Moore (RM)
- R-Matrix Limited (RML)

`resonanceReconstruction` also processes the data in the unresolved region.
